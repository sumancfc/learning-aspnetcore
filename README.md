# ASP.NET Core

Hi, I am learning .NET Core for the very first time. Here, I have created the web app using w3school's template. 
Here is the link for the [demo](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_architect.htm).

I have created the one-page web app into four pages i.e Home, Projects, About and Contact.
